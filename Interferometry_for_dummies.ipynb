    "To get a feel for the fast Fourier transform functionality in numpy, see if you can get the primary beam pattern of single dish, assuming the aperture is uniformly illuminated.\n",

    "As the Fourier transform is discrete and finite, the resulting function will not be perfect. Check to see how the size of the aperture relative to the sampled space and the sampling interval influence the result.\n",

    "**If your results are strange or unexpected**: Whereas we like our signals to be in the middle of the sampled space for aesthetic reasons, the discrete Fourier transform follows the python indexing, which means that the 0-point will be right at the edges of the array. In general, `np.fft.fftshift` is your best friend here, and it is best to use it before and after every Fourier transform. Trust me, this will save you a lot of trouble."
